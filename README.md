# BinToDec
The project was developed in pair programming with https://github.com/mahyar4, whose purpose was to extend our learning in a real project, stimulating even more the practice and problem solving.  We had to develop a site that made the simple conversion of binary numbers to decimal and, in a simple but efficient way, the project below was successfully created.
